# Projects

## Programming 1 - Console Game Project

This C# project was made for an assignment in Programming I. It is an action-packed game that utilises concepts out of the scope of the course along with a moderate usage of mathematics to manipulate vectors in order to allow for relatively balanced gameplay.

| Object Oriented Programming (Classes) | Storing multiple variables and methods such as for vectors or entities |
| Dynamic Arrays (List)                 | Managing creation and deletion of entities                             |

### Code snippets

```c#
public Vec2(float x, float y) {
    m_x = x;
    m_y = y;
}

private float m_x;
private float m_y;

// Access functions
public float x() { return m_x; }
public float y() { return m_y; }
public void setX<T>(T x) { m_x = Convert.ToSingle(x); }
public void setY<T>(T y) { m_y = Convert.ToSingle(y); }
// Get truncated values, used for drawing
public int pixelX() { return (int)m_x; }
public int pixelY() { return (int)m_y; }
```

```c#
        private List<ConsoleKey> m_movementBuffer = new List<ConsoleKey>();

        // ...

        public void addInputToBuffer(ConsoleKey input)
        {
            if (input != Global.INPUT_DASH)
            {
                m_lastDirection = input;
                m_lastDirectionExpiry.startNew(.5f);
            }
            m_movementBuffer.Add(input);
        }
        public void clearInputBuffer()
        {
            m_movementBuffer.Clear();
        }
```

### What I Learned

I learned that trying to learn programming concepts through Google and through online documentation is not sufficient for their efficient usage. The program experiences frequent slowdowns on the average computer, and, although no bugs have been experienced, I am unable to judge whether the implentations are orthodox or not. Furthermore, there is a theoretical possibility in which the program crashes due to the way some mathematical formulas have been handled.

## Programming 2 - Sudoku

This C# project was made $for an assignment in Programming II. It is a console application that runs Sudoku. The code that generates the board was partially written by the professor.

| Technologies Used        | Use case                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Multi-dimensional Arrays | Representing the game board       |
| Random Class             | Randomly selecting tiles to erase |
