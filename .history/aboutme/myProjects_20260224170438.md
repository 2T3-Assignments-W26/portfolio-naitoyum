## Programming 1 - Console Game Project

This C# project was made for an assignment in Programming I. It is an action-packed game that utilises concepts out of the scope of the course along with a moderate usage of mathematics to manipulate vectors in order to allow for relatively balanced gameplay.

### What I Learned

I learned that trying to learn programming concepts through Google and through online documentation is not sufficient for their efficient usage. The program experiences frequent slowdowns on the average computer, and, although no bugs have been experienced, I am unable to judge whether the implentations are orthodox or not. Furthermore, there is a theoretical possibility in which the program crashes due to the way some mathematical formulas have been handled.
